And I break when I fall down.
I am only human.
And I crush and I break down.
Your words in my head.
Knives in my heart.
You bring me up and then I fall apart.
CAuse I  am oly human.

I am only human.
And I break when I fall down.
I am only human.
And I crush and I break down.
Your words in my head.
Knives in my heart.
You bring me up and then I fall apart.
I am only human.
And I break when I fall down.
I am only human.
And I crush and I break down.
Your words in my head.
Knives in my heart.
You bring me up and then I fall apart.
CAuse I  am oly human.
aaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaa.
I am only human.
And I break when I fall down.
I am only human.
And I crush and I break down.
Your words in my head.
Knives in my heart.
You bring me up and then I fall apart.
CAuse I  am oly human.Ause I  am oly human.
